\section*{Research Ethics}
\todo[inline]{Please insert the relevant statement , if appropriate, (select from one of three statements)}
\subsection*{Statement 1:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This module will require you to undertake an ethical review process/application before you carry out any research involving human participants, human data, animals/animal products, precious artefacts, materials or data systems.
	\item Data MUST not be collected without first obtaining ethics approval for your research. If you submit a project that includes data gathered from or about people without ethical approval this may be treated as academic misconduct and could lead to fail grade being awarded.
	\item Research ethics approval seeks to ensure all work is designed and undertaken according to certain principles of ethical research. These include: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Primary concern must be given to the safety, welfare and dignity of participants, researchers, colleagues, the environment and the wider community 
			\item Consideration of risks should be undertaken before research commences with the aim of minimising risks to those involved – i.e. human participants or animal subjects, colleagues, the environment and the wider community, as well as actual or potential risks to those directly or indirectly affected by the research.
			\item Informed consent should be freely given by participants, and by a trained person when collecting or analysing human tissue (details on accessing and completing online training for gaining informed consent for HTA purposes can be found below in Section 8).
			\item Respect for the privacy, confidentiality and anonymity of participants 
			\item Consideration of the rights of people who may be vulnerable (by virtue of perceived or actual differences in their social status, ethnic origin, gender, mental capacities, or other such characteristics) who may be less competent or able to refuse to give consent to participate
			\item Researchers have a responsibility to the general public and to their profession; as such they should balance the anticipated benefits of their research against potential harm, misuse or abuse which must be avoided 
			\item Researchers must demonstrate the highest standards of ethical conduct and research integrity. They must work within the limits of their skills, training and experience, and refrain from exploitation, dishonesty, plagiarism, infringement of intellectual property rights and the fabrication of research results. They should declare any actual or potential conflicts of interest, and where necessary take steps to resolve them. 
			\item When using human tissues for research, Human Tissue Act and Human Tissue Authority (HTA) requirements must be met. Please contact the relevant designated person (DP) in your department or the HTA Designated Individual (DI) (Dr Lucy Ghali - \href{mailto:L.Ghali@mdx.ac.uk}{L.Ghali@mdx.ac.uk}). Further information is provided below in the section: ``Human Tissue Authority Information'', see ``Governance Structure'' document and SOPs etc.

\section{Assessment}
%%% Please amend as needed
\textbf{Formative assessment}: Formative assessments do not directly contribute to the overall module mark but they do provide an important opportunity to receive feedback on your learning. They provide an opportunity to evaluate and reflect on your understanding of what you have learnt. They also help your tutors identify what further support and guidance can be given to improve your grade. 

On this module you will have the following formative assessment opportunities. \todo[inline]{Please state any formative activities and deadlines for feedback on these within the module.}

\textbf{Summative assessment}: Summative assessment is the assessed work that determines the overall module grade. It is the way the University verifies that students have met the learning outcomes at the appropriate level. 

There are \todo[inline]{Insert number} assessment components in this module \todo[inline]{List them.:

\emph{Include a table of deadlines for the module and then provide details for each in turn. Examples of how this can be done have been provided in a separate document.} For example:
}
\textbf{Assessment 1}
\todo[inline]{(insert title e.g. Programming assignment)}

\todo[inline]{Provide the following details for each assessment }
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{nature of the assessment,}
	\item \emph{assessment brief}
	\item \emph{\% weighting, }
	\item \emph{deadline}

	\item \emph{feedback return date. }
	\item \emph{marking criteria rubric. }
	\item \emph{additional grading criteria for example:}
	
	\emph{In order to pass this module, you need to achieve an aggregated pass overall and must achieve a minimum of grade 18 or above in all assessment tasks. 
	All threshold SOBs must be demonstrated to pass the module.}

	\item \emph{Please include any PRSB requirements, e.g. compensation not permitted. }
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Assessment 2 }

\textbf{Assessment 3}

\section*{Feedback on your assignments}
You will be provided with feedback on all assessment that is helpful and informative, consistent with aiding the learning and development process. 

Feedback will normally be provided within 15 working days of the published assessment component submission date.

\section*{Overall module grade}
%%% Please amend as needed
\todo[inline]{Indicate how the overall module grade will be calculated. For example }

Each component of assessment will be marked directly onto the 20-point scale based on the assessment criteria. To produce the overall module grade a weighted average percentage will be calculated using the midpoint percentage in the scale below and then converted to a 20-point grade.

\todo[inline]{Or} 

Each component of assessment will be marked as a percentage. To produce the overall module grade a weighted average percentage will be calculated and then converted to a 20-point grade using the scale below.

\todo[inline]{Add in any assessment hurdles needed for individual assessment components needed to pass overall so for example}

In order to pass this module, you need to pass all assessment tasks with a minimum grade of 17/18/16 or equivalent.
\todo[inline]{(Please include any PRSB requirements)}

Before you submit your work for final grading, please ensure that you have accurately referenced the work.  It is your responsibility to check the spelling and grammar.  If you have submitted a formative or draft assessment, you will receive feedback but no grade. The comments should inform you about how well you have done or tell you about the areas for improvement. All assignments should be submitted online unless specified in assessment briefs.

Reassessment for this module normally takes place in the following way:
\todo[inline]{add detail on when reassessment is normally held, include any PSRB requirements that constrain reassessment; where the module is by continuous assessment or reassessment eg SOBs indicate that this provides the reassessment opportunity; where students have the opportunity to undertake reassessment in year indicate that this provides the reassessment opportunity.}

\section*{Anonymous Marking Assessment Policy}
We have worked with the MDXSU to create an anonymous marking policy, in response to student feedback.  Anonymous marking ensures that your identity (your name, student number and other personal/identifiable information) is not made available to academics when they are marking your work.  This means that you can have confidence that your assessments will be marked fairly and consistently.  However, there are some forms of assessment for which anonymity cannot be guaranteed and these are recognised in the policy.  We believe that it is important to provide you with the support and guidance needed to help you develop and prepare for your final assessments (those which count towards your final grades i.e. summative assessments).  Therefore, anonymous marking will not apply to learning activities and assessments that do not contribute to your final grades (i.e. formative assessments).  If you require further information and support to understand how anonymous marking works in your programme modules please contact the Module Leader for more information.
